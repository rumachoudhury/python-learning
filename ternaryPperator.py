# The ternary operator allows you to assign one value if a condition is true, and another if it is false:

# Assign a value to x:

# Assign the value "WEEKEND!" if the number is higher than 5, otherwise "Workday":

num = 6

x = "WEEKEND!" if num > 5 else "Workday"

print(x)

# -------------------------
# The ternary operator can be used instead of elif in longer if statements:

# Assign:
# - "Fri" if num is 5
# - "Sat" if num is 6
# - "Sun" if num is 7
# - otherwise assign "weekday":

num = 6

x = "Fri" if num == 5 else "Sat" if num == 6 else "Sun" if num == 7 else "weekday"

print(x)
