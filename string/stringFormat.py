# As we learned in the Python Variables chapter, we cannot combine strings and numbers like this:

# age = 36

# This will be error

# txt = "My name is Ruma, I am " + age

# print(txt)

# =============================================

# F-Strings
# But we can combine strings and numbers by using f-strings or the format() method!
# To specify a string as an f-string, simply put an f in front of the string literal, and add curly brackets {} as placeholders for variables and other operations.

age = 36
txt = f"My name is Ruma, I am {age} years old" 
print(txt)

# =============================================

# Placeholders and Modifiers
# A placeholder can contain variables, operations, functions, and modifiers to format the value.

price = 60
txt = f"The price is {price} Dollars"
print (txt)




# A modifier is included by adding a colon : followed by a legal formatting type, like .2f which means fixed point number with 2 decimals:

# Display the price with 2 decimals

price = 59
txt = f"The price is {price:.2f} dollars"
print (txt)

# =============================================

# A placeholder can contain Python code, like math operations:
txt = f"The price is {20 * 59} dollars"
print(txt)
