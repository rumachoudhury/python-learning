# The match statement selects one of many code blocks to be executed.

# SyntaxGet your own Python Server
# match expression:
#   case x:
#     code block
#   case y:
#     code block
#   case z:
#     code block

# This is how it works:

# The match expression is evaluated once.
# The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
# If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.

day = 4
match day:
  case 1:
    print("Monday")
  case 2:
    print("Tuesday")
  case 3:
    print("Wednesday")
  case 4:
    print("Thursday")
  case 5:
    print("Friday")
  case 6:
    print("Saturday")
  case 7:
    print("Sunday")

# =================================
# Default Value
# Use the underscore character _ as the last case value if you want a code block to execute when there are not other matches:

day = 4
match day:
  case 6:
    print("Today is Saturday")
  case 7:
    print("Today is Sunday")
  case _:
    print("Looking forward to the Weekend")

# =================================
# Combine Values
# Use the pipe character | as an or operator in the case evaluation to check for more than one value match in one case:

day = 4
match day:
  case 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5:
    print("Today is a weekday")
  case 6 | 7:
    print("I love weekends!")
